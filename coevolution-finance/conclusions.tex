\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

All implemented algorithms have been exhaustively tested using historical data reflecting completely different situations on the market.
Taking into consideration both good and bad times leads to conclusions that all approaches have advantages as well as disadvantages.
That raises a question what algorithm to use if we want to build our own portfolio.
Trend following is good for unstable times because it somehow guarantees that the losses would be minimalised according to our preferences.
However, during stock market rise it is outperformed by other algorithms.
