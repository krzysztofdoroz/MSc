\section{Previous Research}
\label{sec:previous-research}

Many researchers worked on application of evolutionary algorithms to portfolio optimization problem.

Authors of \cite{Drezewski:2009:CMC:1533570.1533599} focused on comparison of evolutionary algorithms with multi-agent co-evolutionary algorithms.
They concluded that further research is needed as obtained results suggested that neither agent-based approach nor classical algorithms can obtain good results
for all kind of problems.

Evolutionary approach was compared with simple investing strategies and stock market index in \cite{Lipinski:2009:BRP:1574739.1574764}.
In some cases the proposed technique outperformed basic Buy\&Hold strategy as well as market index.

Co-evolutionary multi-agent system is presented in \cite{Drezewski:2009:MOT:1574739.1574761}.
The system was run against well-known test problems as well as portfolio optimization problem.
Results obtained from both tests proved the CoEMAS approach to be robust.
